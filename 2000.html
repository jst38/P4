            <h5>Basketball in the 2000s:</h5>
<p>NBA basketball in the 2000s has its share of detractors because of the style of play, but it deserves appreciation because
     there was still greatness every single night. The studs who played within the era speak for themselves, from Kobe Bryant to 
     Kevin Garnett to Tim Duncan to LeBron James to a host of others who helped pave the way for the stars of today. Thereâ€™s 
     just something about the mystique of this specific decade of basketball. It might not have always been the prettiest basketball, 
     but these guys went to war every night and battled. The 2000s helped many find a passion for basketball after the Michael Jordan 
     dynasty and the lockout closed out the prior decade.</p>
